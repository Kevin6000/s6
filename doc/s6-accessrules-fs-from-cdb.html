<h1> The <tt>s6-accessrules-fs-from-cdb</tt> program </h1>

<p>
<tt>s6-accessrules-fs-from-cdb</tt> decompiles a CDB database
containing a ruleset suitable for
<a href="s6-ipcserver-access.html">s6-ipcserver-access<a> or
<a href="//skarnet.org/software/s6-networking/s6-tcpserver-access.html">s6-tcpserver-access<a> and
that has been compiled with
<a href="s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs.html">s6-accessrules-cdb-from-fs<a>.
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

<pre>
     s6-accessrules-fs-from-cdb <em>dir</em> <em>cdbfile</em>
</pre>

<ul>
 <li> s6-accessrules-fs-from-cdb decompiles the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdb_(software)">CDB file</a>
<em>cdbfile</em> into the directory <em>dir</em>, then exits 0. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Notes </h2>

<ul>
 <li> <em>dir</em> must not exist prior to the decompilation. </li>
 <li> <em>dir</em> must be considered a work in progress as long as
s6-accessrules-fs-from-cdb is running. It is only safe to use <em>dir</em>
as a ruleset once the program has exited. </li>
 <li> If s6-accessrules-fs-from-cdb fails at some point, the partial
arborescence at <em>dir</em> is removed. However, this doesn't happen if
s6-accessrules-fs-from-cdb is interrupted by a signal. </li>
 <li> After the program successfully completes, if <em>cdbfile</em>
was a suitable candidate for the <tt>-x</tt> option of
<a href="s6-ipcserver-access.html">s6-ipcserver-access</a> or
<a href="s6-tcpserver-access.html">s6-tcpserver-access</a>, then
<em>dir</em> will be a suitable candidate for the <tt>-i</tt> option
of the same program, implementing the same ruleset. </li>
</ul>

       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
